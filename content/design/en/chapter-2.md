Jakob Nielson defines it by five quality components which are:

#####Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks for the first time.
#####Efficiency: Once the user have learned the design/flow, how quickly they can perform tasks?
#####Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of time, how easy for them to re establish efficiency.
#####Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors and how easily can they recover from the error.
#####Satisfaction: How good is it to use the design.
