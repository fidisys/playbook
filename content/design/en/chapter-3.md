Prototype can be in the form of:

1. Paper sketches
2. Invision or Marvel clickable
3. Static HTML and CSS

Usability is an attribute that determines a product’s ease of use. Jakob Nielson defines usability by five quality components which are:

✍️ Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks for the first time.

✍️ Efficiency: Once the user have learned the design/flow, how quickly they can perform tasks?

✍️ Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of time, how easy for them to re establish efficiency.

✍️ Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors and how easily can they recover from the error.

✍️ Satisfaction: How good is it to use the design.
