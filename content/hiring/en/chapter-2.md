✍️ We follow simple steps to shortlist and evaluate our full time employees

1. Telephonic/face to face conversation on whether the candidate is interested in the opportunity

2. Hands on task is our major step in hiring. We look for the genuineness, time management, dedicative nature among the candidate

3. Technical/Cultural/HR fit rounds - these are usual rounds in any tech company

4. Founders interview - Meeting with the founding team on the vision and value of the company and check the alignment of candidate's aspiration
