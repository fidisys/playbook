✍️ We follow time tracking for every employee in our organization.

✍️ In case of services to our client, timesheet is shared to them every week and for internal project it is tracked and maintained within the organization.

✍️ This will help us to keep track of the projects and forecast on future plans.

✍️ It would also be helpful in legal and financial processing.
