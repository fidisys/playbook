✍️ Design Sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with final users and customers; basically, a way to solve design problems quickly.

✍️ Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, you’ll get clear data from a realistic prototype.

✍️ Design sprint can be 2 weeks where we do user research to understand our client problems, validating the assumptions.

✍️ By doing so it helps us to build products that are user centred. Design sprints is an iterative process of converting the ideas into prototype until we find the problem solution.

✍️ Applying this in the product development lifecycle will cut down most of the time rather by building the product and launching it then revamping it if it doesn't fit to the user need.
