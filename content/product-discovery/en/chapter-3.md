✍️ Understand

First stage in the design sprint is to understand what is the problem we are trying to solve and to whom we are trying
to solve. Understanding these will let us know the challenges and tech stack we could incorporate in building the product. Hence it necessary to invite the right people who share the business goals and experts in the releavant field.

✍️ Diverge and Sketch

This stage allow the team to look for all the possible solutions that could solve the use case. These solutions are then crafted as a sketch and mapped with one complete flow. Doing so will narraw down diverge ideas to one well defined solution. This is the stage where most of the brainstorming sessions happens among the team to come up with valid answer.

✍️ Review

Based on the solutions we are arrived during the diverge and sketch stage, the solution is reviewed multiple time before it gets converted to prototype.

✍️ Prototype

It converts the sketches into clickable interface. This stage saves lot of time and resources by building a mock product which depicts how the application user interface and usability will look like. Prototyping only the ideas we need to validate and keeping it as simple as possible.

✍️ Validate

Testing the prototype with the users who are our target audience. In this stage the team will receive feedback from the users and stackholders. Validating the prototype will reveal major issues in design which are iterated again until we achieve the expected and positive feedback.
