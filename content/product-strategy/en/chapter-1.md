✍️ Design sprints help us to identify critical business questions and testing the ideas with the customer.

✍️ Design sprints can be 2 weeks where we do user research to understand our client problems, validating the assumptions.

✍️ By doing so it helps us to build products that are user centred. Design sprints is an iterative process of converting the ideas into prototype until they find the problem solution.

✍️ Applying this in the product development lifecycle will cut down most of the time rather by building the product and launching it then revamping it if it doesn't fit to the user need.
