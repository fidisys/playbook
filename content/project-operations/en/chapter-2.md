✍️ The first step in any work is to define what needs to be done.

✍️ Based on the product strategy and project charter we decided on our business goals and validated with lot of tools, technologies and ideas to achieve those goals.

✍️ In backlog grooming we break down our business goals into specific tasks which can be implemented in every sprint.

✍️ These tasks are termed as user stories and it’s product owner responsibility to fill the backlog with the user stories.
