✍️ Minimum Viable Product(MVP) is considered to be the simplest, functional product that can be released and distributed to consumers.

✍️ There are specific criteria that MVP’s must adhere to prior to release:

1. Product must have enough values so that people will buy or use it.
2. Product must have future potential that it can retain and enable continued use from early adopters.
3. Product must provide a feedback loop to guide developers through future versions.
